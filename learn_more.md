# Recommended web pages
Here is a list of sites we find nice and good for learning more cyber security.

## Learning Security/CTF
* [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/) explains common 
vulnerabilities, and describes how to prevent them when coding.
* [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) 
is a YouTube channel containing lots of videos about "computers and 
computer stuff". 
* [Ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA/videos) is
another YouTube channel explaining walkthroughs for __retired__ "HackTheBox" machines.
He also offers great tips and tricks for penetration testing and how to get better at CTFs in
general. See [the section below](#nice-puzzles-for-learning-more-hacking) for more info about the pentesting lab "HackTheBox".
* [Liveoverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
is a YouTube channel with loads of hacking and CTF videos.
* [GynvaelEN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkVMojdBWS-JtH7TliWkVg) is a YouTuber from the CTF team Dragon Sector.
* [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw)
another YouTuber with CTF writeups.
* [How HTTPS Works](https://howhttps.works/) is a funny web page 
explaining how HTTPS works through a nice comic. 
* [Hacking Arena](https://www.hackingarena.no/challenges/web/) is the university of Oslo's 
web page for hacking tasks. Some tasks contains solutions.
* [BlackHoodie](https://www.blackhoodie.re/) offers free, women only workshops within the security
and hacking domain. We definitely recommend all women and non-binary people to check out
their workshops. 

### In Oslo/Norway
* UiO-CTF's practical workshops are very nice to learn how to solve CTF 
tasks. Every workshop takes a CTF category as a topic, and go through the 
steps of one or a few tasks within that category. Each workshop ends with 
a mini CTF with tasks of the topic. The workshops take place at the Department 
of Informatics, at University of Oslo, and are posted as events on their
[facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/uioctf).
* University teams: 
  * NTNU Trondheim has Itemize.
  * University of Oslo has [UiO-CTF](https://discord.gg/E24KzaJ). 
  * University of Troms√∏ has UiT Hack. 
  * University of Agder has ??.
  * University of Bergen has ??. 
* [Norwegian Cyber Security Challenge](https://www.ntnu.no/ncsc) has an
open Jeopardy styled CTF once a year. The top teams under the age of 25
are invited to a final round having different challenges. The ones with 
hacking skills and the ability to hack in teams, are invited to join the 
Norwegian team for the European Cyber Security Challenge. 

### Learning reverse engineering
* [Malware Unicorn's Reverse Engineering 101](https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re101.html)

### Learning pwn
* [BlackHoodie-2018-Workshop](https://github.com/tharina/BlackHoodie-2018-Workshop): 
supernice slides and challenges for learning introductions to pwn. 
Stack overflows, stack frame and short on ROP (return oriented programming)

## More CTFs
* [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) is a page containing most CTFs in the 
world. Most of these are quite hard, but sometimes there are very nice
beginner CTFs here as well. 
* [Major Cyber League](https://www.majorleaguecyber.org/), a new site like
CTFtime, where CTF's are posted and teams and users are ranked. It seems
like it is brand new, so some functionality is missing.
* [CTF Norge](https://discord.gg/P4X4WyN) on Discord posts a few university
CTFs now and then in the #ctf channel.
* Looking for a team (and live in Norway or are from Norway)? The 
university team [UiO-CTF](https://discord.gg/E24KzaJ) is more than happy 
to compete with you.

## Nice puzzles for learning more hacking
* [Overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames) is a very nice website for 
different puzzles. The category __bandit__ has terminal puzzles and __narnia__ 
contains exploit intro puzzles.
* [Google gruyere](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) is a cheesy vulnerable 
web app to learn web application exploits and defenses.
* [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/) contains exploit puzzles.
* [pwnable.tv](http://pwnable.tv/) contains exploit puzzles.
* [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1) crypto challenges contains, as 
its name says, crypto challenges.
* [Juice shop](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project), an 
intentionally insecure web page. 
* [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), "Hack The Box is an online platform 
allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and 
methodologies with other members of similar interests."
* [TGHack's old tasks](https://github.com/tghack) on github. 

## Secure Coding
* [OWASP Secure Coding Dojo](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-dojo/)
is a very nice resource for secure development training. It is easy to set up
locally and has documentation to set up as a workshop for several participant 
using the cloud. This is a resource that may be presented to development teams 
to spread the word about secure development!
* [Secure Code Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/) is a platform to spot 
security issues in several programming languages. The downside is that is seems
to be focused on enterprise. However, we've heard that universities may get 
some deals, so it is worth the try to contact them if you want to host something
for a university group!
