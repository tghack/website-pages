# FAQ
## About TG:Hack
TG:Hack is a (semi) onsite jeopardy style CTF at The Gathering in the Viking 
ship in Hamar running each Easter. This year, we host some of our tasks publicly 
(see the next section). Our focus is making learning and guiding tasks for beginners, 
and more challenging tasks for the experienced ones.

## Important information
This year, we are changing the game a bit! We may finally publish some of our
tasks publicly. However, we only publish the tasks having the difficulties 
_n00b_, _easy_ and _challenging_ publicly. The _hard_ and _crazy_ tasks 
are only hosted at the onsite event at [The Gathering](https://www.gathering.org/tg19).

After The Gathering has ended and prizes are given, we open the tasks with the 
_hard_ and _crazy_ difficulties publicly. Then, the tasks will be available until 
1st of January 2020. At that point, we will start getting ready for #tg20hack!
We also post our writeups around the end of the competition, so hosting the tasks 
after the event is for learning purposes. 

So, this is the schedule for task releases:

**15th of February, 20:00**: n00b task release. At this release, only the tasks having
the n00b difficulty are published. These tasks has a tutorial related to them, 
so that beginners get a nice start in their hacker journey. 

**17th of April, 18:00**: Main competition release. Tasks are hosted every day at
12.00 and/or 18.00. Non-ticket holders gets to see and solve tasks with the 
_n00b_, _easy_, and _challenging_ tasks.

**20th of April 18.00**: Main competition ends. All _hard_ and _crazy_ will soon be 
open publicly. Writeups will be posted within a week.

**NB! Only onsite competitors may win prizes. The top 5-10 teams may be questioned 
about their solutions.**

If you have a ticket for The Gathering, we recommend registering a team with others
that also have a ticket. That is because all tasks are only shown to a team consisting
of _only_ people with tickets. That way you will avoid having to make someone leave your 
team or having to leave the team yourselves and entering all the flags again.

## What is CTF?
CTF is short for Capture The Flag, and is a type of hacking competition. The most known types of hacking competitions are Jeopardy-style CTF and attack-defence CTF. At TG:Hack, we host a Jeopardy-style CTF. As in Jeopardy, there are several categories, each of them having several tasks with a certain amount of points. The points usually represent the difficulty of the task.

## What are the different categories?
There are several categories in CTFs. We present the most common categories, and the ones we use in our contest.

#### Crypto
Crypto is short for cryptography, where information is protected by encrypting it (some kind of transformation) into an unreadable format, also referred to as the cipher text. The cipher text may only be read by the ones possessing the secret key to decipher or decrypt it.

#### Misc
Misc is short for miscellaneous, and contains all the tasks that do not fit in any of the other categories. Sometimes, this means that it's a task that spans several categories.

#### Pwn
Pwning a system is the act of exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges than intended. In this category, you have to discover vulnerabilities and leverage them to gain remote code execution. This is by far the most difficult category.

#### Reversing
Reverse engineering is the act of picking apart a system to figure out how it works. In this category you will have to discover how different programs work to recover hidden flags and other information.

#### Forensics (and Stego)
In forensics, you must investigate the files to find hiddes clues and messages. The files can be packet captures from network traffic, or any other file such as pictures, zipped files, or text files. The category is very similar to another category called stego. Stego is short for steganography and is the hiding of a secret message within something, for instance in a picture. For example by hiding a zip file inside a picture.

#### Web
In the web tasks, you have to discover weaknesses in different web sites and services. Most of the tasks are done in your web browser. Common web tasks include SQL-injections, XSS, input sanitation.

#### AFK
AFK is short for _away from keyboard_. When a CTF is hosted at some place, AFK tasks usually require one to be present at that certain place. In TG:Hack, you are usually required to visit the Creative Lounge, and we LOVE when you guys come talk to us!^_^)/*

# Common questions
## How do I participate?
To participate, register with your Geekevents or Unicorn account through this web page.

## How many may join our team?
There is usually no limit in the number of members within a CTF team. For instance, our team 0xc0ffee has about ten members, usually about two or three team members active in a competition. However, remember that the monetary price is divided among the team.

## What should I deliver?
This type of hacking competition is called a CTF. CTF is short for Capture The Flag, and the aim of each challenge is to get hold of a flag. A flag is in the format TG19{welc0me_hackerman}. Maybe you can submit that flag? The flag is human readable, so that it is somewhat easy to separate from other text. Each challenge specify what you should do or deliver in order to fulfill the requirements. If the flag is not in the ordinary format, it is specified in the challenge.

## How do I win?
For each challenge solved you are awarded with points. The winner is the team having the most points. If two teams share the same score, the one that obtained the score first wins.
 
## Do I need hacker experience?
No, you do not! We have made it possible for anyone, with or without hacker or programming experience to try a little bit of hacking! We have made a tutorial for beginners, and tasks for this tutorial in the category `n00b` on the front page. The other categories contain beginner tasks as well, which are marked with the text `n00b`. Please, do not be afraid to come by the Creative Lounge to ask for help!

## How do I find more CTFs?

# Important juridical information
Hacking systems and networks without permission is illegal. We do not encourage or condone abusing or breaking into systems to which you have not been granted explicit access. This competition is intended to teach awareness about methods and techniques so that you can protect yourself from them, not to use them against others.

## Misconduct
You may only work against targets which the specific tasks lead you to. You are not under any circumstances to attack any computer systems, web sites or other infrastructure outside the specific assignments of this competition. In addition, you may not attack the infrastructure of the competition, including but not limited to the competition website and/or related equipment.

## Fair play
Although the hacking competition is competitive, do not sabotage, distort, misdirect, destroy or in any other way prevent the progress of the other participants.

## Valid Contestants/Teams
Only contestants that have a valid ticket for The Gathering may win prizes. In order to compete in the main competition, all of your team members must have a valid ticket. If we are to discover that any of the teams participating in the main competition have participants that have not paid for a ticket, the team will be disqualified. You may compete with a day ticket, but we encourage everyone to participate the whole week and also in the awards ceremony. Winning teams should preferably be present at the awards ceremony. 

We recommend for those going to The Gathering to register a teams with other LAN-goers. If one of your team members does not have a ticket, your team will not be able to register flags for all tasks. That means that either the ones with a ticket or those without tickets have to leave the team and make their own, and then insert all the flags again.  

## Keep your secrets
You are not allowed to provide or distribute any solutions to other participants. You are however allowed to collaborate and discuss the tasks with others, provided that your final solution to any task is your own.

## Disqualification
Breaking these rules will result in immediate disqualification. The competition organizers will be the sole judge of what qualifies as breaking the rules. The decision to disqualify any participant is final and not open for appeals.
