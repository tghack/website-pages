# Tips and tools

This page is meant to help you on your journey of becoming a 1337 hacker 
(in CTFs). We will tell you about a few tools that will help you on your way. 
A part of the hacker training is to get your black belt in google-foo. You 
need to train your google-foo skills, so we can not provide you with much 
information on how to use the tools! As all hackers know, the learning curve 
in hacking is tremendously steep, but when your hacker and google skills 
arrive at a certain level, the thirst for knowledge is hard to stop and you 
suddenly obtain your black belt in google-foo.

In addition to providing the list of tools on this page, we have a little
starting kit for your hacker journey, beginner tutorials on how to get started 
with different topics within CTFs!! Those of you who have a little experience 
with CTFs and this year's n00b categories may find it more fun to jump straight 
to the challenges:

* [Tutorials](/page/Tutorial) 
* [Challenges](/categories). All tutorial tasks are moved to the _n00b_ 
category before main competition begins.

## Tools
### General tools
* [Google, google and more google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google): Searching for 
information and learning new things by doing so, might be the most powerful tool 
for hackers! And remember, you need to train hard to get your google-foo black belt!
* By googling: Web pages with converting programs, e.g. hex to ascii. Calculators 
and decoders for different ciphers within cryptography. And a lot more!!!

## Tips for binary files
* Binaries may be run in the terminal by putting a `./` in front of it. However, we must know that it is an executable first. We may check that by using either [**file**](#Terminal-tools) or [**binwalk**](#Terminal-tools). 
* Sometimes a binary must be changed to be an executable. That may happen if you get an error while trying to run the executable, such as a message saying permission denied. You may try fix that by using the terminal command `chmod +x binaryname`, and run it again.
* You may input things to a binary by piping input into the binary, like in the two following terminal commands:

```sh
$ echo "Hello!" | ./binary_name
$ python3 -c 'print("A" * 30)' | ./binary_name
```
	
* To find all functions in an executable, you can use `readelf -a ./executable`, or sometimes it is possible to simply write `disas ` and autocomplete when in [gdb-peda](#gdb-peda) to get a list of functions. 
The source code of an executable have the same information, as all the functions are written inside the code. Therefore, this step may only be useful for the tasks that do not provide source files. 
However, you could try to run the command on a task where the source code is provided, to test it and see if you understand it.

## Tips for gdp-peda
* gdb-peda is a plugin for your terminal to make debugging easier and more understandable.
* Download gdb-peda from [this site](https://github.com/longld/peda).
* Useful commands:
  * Run with `gdb-peda$ r`
  * Disassemble with `gdb-peda$ disas functionname`
  * Find memory address of a function by entering `gdb-peda$ p functionname` 
  * Set breakpoint using `gdb-peda$ b *memoryadress` or `gdb-peda$ b functionname`
* Read the tutorial if you want to see examples of usage.
