## About TG:HACK
TG:HACK is a beginner friendly jeopardy style CTF. It is both onsite and offsite, as well 
as a wargame. Our focus is making guiding tasks for beginners, and challenging tasks 
for the experienced ones. We upload an offsite highscore list to CTFtime. 

Every easter [The Gathering](https://www.gathering.org/) hosts a three day CTF in 
the [Viking ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikingskipet) in Hamar. 
<i>It is required to have a valid ticket for the event to 
win prizes. Also, solving a few tasks (e.g. lockpicking and hardware tasks) require 
participants to be onsite, so you should try to join us in the Viking ship next easter!</i> 
Not this year, though. :'( 

We have a pre-contest for beginners, starting two months before the main competition.
**The main competition starts the first Wednesday each Easter. Wed, 08 apr. 2020, 18:00 UTC+2 â€” sat, 11 apr. 2020, 18:00 UTC+2.**

The rest of the year, the tasks are open as a wargame. You may log in and solve tasks all year to improve your CTF skills!

Writeups will be published at https://github.com/tghack shortly after the competition has ended.

NOTICE! Due to COVID-19 we will only have an online competition.

## What is CTF?
CTF is short for Capture The Flag, and is a type of hacking competition. The most known types of hacking competitions are Jeopardy-style CTF and attack-defence CTF. At TG:HACK, we host a Jeopardy-style CTF. As in Jeopardy, there are several categories, each of them having several tasks with a certain amount of points. The points usually represent the difficulty of the task.

## What are the different categories?
There are several categories in CTFs. We present the most common categories, and the ones we use in our contest.

#### Crypto
Crypto is short for cryptography, where information is protected by encrypting it (some kind of transformation) into an unreadable format, also referred to as the cipher text. The cipher text may only be read by the ones possessing the secret key to decipher or decrypt it.

#### Misc
Misc is short for miscellaneous, and contains all the tasks that do not fit in any of the other categories. Sometimes, this means that it's a task that spans several categories.

#### Pwn
Pwning a system is the act of exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges than intended. In this category, you have to discover vulnerabilities and leverage them to gain remote code execution. This is by far the most difficult category.

#### Reversing
Reverse engineering is the act of picking apart a system to figure out how it works. In this category you will have to discover how different programs work to recover hidden flags and other information.

#### Forensics (and Stego)
In forensics, you must investigate the files to find hiddes clues and messages. The files can be packet captures from network traffic, or any other file such as pictures, zipped files, or text files. The category is very similar to another category called stego. Stego is short for steganography and is the hiding of a secret message within something, for instance in a picture. For example by hiding a zip file inside a picture.

#### Web
In the web tasks, you have to discover weaknesses in different web sites and services. Most of the tasks are done in your web browser. Common web tasks include SQL-injections, XSS, input sanitation.

#### AFK
AFK is short for _away from keyboard_. When a CTF is hosted at some place, AFK tasks usually require one to be present at that certain place. In TG:HACK, you are usually required to visit the Creative Lounge, and we LOVE when you guys come talk to us!^_^)/*

# Common questions
## How do I participate?
To participate, you must register a user with the "Login with TG:HACK" button. ~~There are two ways to do this; "Login with Unicorn" or "Login with TG:HACK". If you want to be eligible to win prizes, you must have a valid ticket and register with Unicorn. You may register with TG:HACK first, and then change to Unicorn at any time, as long as the same email is used.~~ 

## How many may join our team?
There is usually no limit in the number of members within a CTF team. For instance, our team [bootplug](https://ctftime.org/team/81341) has about ten members, usually about three or four team members active in a competition. However, remember that the monetary price is divided among the team.

## What should I deliver?
This type of hacking competition is called a CTF. CTF is short for Capture The Flag, and the aim of each challenge is to get hold of a flag. A flag is in the format TG20{welcome_hackerman}. The flag is human readable, so that it is somewhat easy to separate from other text. Each challenge specify what you should do or deliver in order to fulfill the requirements. If the flag is not in the ordinary format, it is specified in the challenge.

## How do I win?
You are awarded with points for each challenge solved. The winner is the team having the most points. If two teams share the same score, the one that obtained the score first wins. If your team solve all the tasks first, you win the competition.
 
## Do I need hacker experience?
No, you do not! We have made it possible for anyone, with or without hacker or programming experience to try a little bit of hacking! We have made a tutorial for beginners, and tasks for this tutorial in the category `n00b` on the front page. The other categories contain beginner tasks as well, which are marked with the text `n00b`. Please, do not be afraid to come by the Creative Lounge to ask for help!

## How do I find more CTFs?
There are CTFs almost every week. Check out [CTFtime's](https://ctftime.org/) or [Major Cyber League's](https://www.majorleaguecyber.org/) web page. They contain all the coming CTFs and rates all the registered teams by looking at the solved tasks in CTFs. Register and compete against other teams!
 
## What is TG:HACK's role with Creative and TG?
Creative is the part of The Gathering that arrange workshops, presentations and hosts a lot of competitions. We have been hosting the hacking competition through UiO as a sponsor, but since 2018 we have been a part of the TG Crew and TG:HACK is now a Creative competition.

## Can I find solutions for the tasks?
After the competition, we go through a set of tasks chosen by you guys ~~at the Creative 
auditorium! The walkthrough takes place 20.00 o'clock on the Saturday each easter, and 
we have two hours available.~~ On Friday, we publish a poll on the front page, so make 
sure to vote on the tasks you want to learn how to solve. 
The walkthrough will be streamed. Further information will be announced on Twitter and Discord. 

All of the tasks have 
writeups that will be published a little while after the competition ends. The writeups 
contain possible solutions, and is written so that you should be able to learn how to solve 
similar tasks in the future. We hope to get time to publish the writeups to 
[CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/70867) as well.

# Important juridical information
OBS! We will update these rules before the main competitions starts!!

Hacking systems and networks without permission is illegal. We do not encourage or condone abusing or breaking into systems to which you have not been granted explicit access. This competition is intended to teach awareness about methods and techniques so that you can protect yourself from them, not to use them against others.

## Misconduct
You may only work against targets which the specific tasks lead you to. You are not under any circumstances to attack any computer systems, web sites or other infrastructure outside the specific assignments of this competition. In addition, you may not attack the infrastructure of the competition, including but not limited to the competition website and/or related equipment.

## Information storage
For security purposes we store logs and network data collected from our cloud infrastructure. After the event is finished, all data is wiped.
We are happy to answer any questions regarding this.

## Fair play
Although the hacking competition is competitive, do not sabotage, distort, misdirect, destroy or in any other way prevent the progress of the other participants.

## Valid Contestants/Teams
Only contestants that have a valid ticket for The Gathering may win prizes. In order to compete in the main competition, all of your team members must have a valid ticket. If we are to discover that any of the teams participating in the main competition have participants that have not paid for a ticket, the team will be disqualified. You may compete with a day ticket, but we encourage everyone to participate the whole week and also in the awards ceremony. Winning teams should preferably be present at the awards ceremony. 

We recommend for those going to The Gathering to register a teams with other LAN-goers. If one of your team members does not have a ticket, your team will not be able to register flags for all tasks. That means that either the ones with a ticket or those without tickets have to leave the team and make their own, and then insert all the flags again.  

## Keep your secrets
You are not allowed to provide or distribute any solutions to other teams. You are however allowed to discuss the tasks with others, provided that your final solution to any task is your own and you do not share your solution with others. It is _not_ allowed to discuss possible solutions, or ask guiding questions to point someone towards a possible solution.

## Disqualification
Breaking these rules will result in immediate disqualification. The competition organizers will be the sole judge of what qualifies as breaking the rules. The decision to disqualify any participant is final and not open for appeals.
